### frustration and resignation to failure

Our group has basically given up. We have expressed many times that we are confused and behind. 

Nothing has actually been taught to us. None of us are networking enthusiasts. All of us were hoping to learn more about networking in this class, but instead were just given: busy work beyond our comprehension, stress from falling so far behind, blogs to write about some imaginary learning journey, and the responsibility of teaching ourselves what we paid NMIT, in good faith, to teach us. 

I have attended nearly every class this semester. I have spent each class working on the assessment, trying to understand and teach myself enough to accomplish parts of the requirements so that I could contribute to my groups. We still have only been able to accomplish fragments of what was required. Nothing about this has been beneficial or educational for any of us.
