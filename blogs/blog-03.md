# Blog - 03

### still on binaries, mostly

covered binaries again. cant find many resources on the way its being taught, mostly how to write a subnetting table like in my earlier blog or how to use a subnetting calculator.

we discussed application first network design and how it is used to create a network from specific user requirements. 

then we tried to setup our pfsense, with little luck. after, lars came and set it up for us.
