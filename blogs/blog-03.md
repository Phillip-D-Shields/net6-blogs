### still on binaries, mostly

covered binaries again. cant find many resources on the way its being taught, mostly how to write a subnetting table like in my earlier blog or how to use a subnetting calculator.

we discussed application first network design and how it is used to create a network from specific user requirements. Then using this to as a guideline to begin building the network using the appilication layer of the OSI model. 

We tried to setup our pfsense, but couldnt. Lars came and set it up for us.

We haven't been given any practical examples or exercises. No one in our group seems to understand what the actual assessment requirements are.
