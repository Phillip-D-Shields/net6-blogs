### still on binaries

we reviewed binary conversion for subnets and talked a small amount about the actual network setup. pretty sure most of us are confused. The tables I found useful in my previous blog are not comparable to the method taught in class, not sure why. I am still struggling with the subnetting being taught in class.

we worked for a while on getting our basic vm clients setup with fedora and ubuntu. We have them installed and running, but not yet connected to the internet.
