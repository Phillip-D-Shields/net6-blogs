### lars is gone

Lars is gone. We worked on our virtual machine network for a bit. Most members in my group are confused as to whats expected and how to achieve it.

We have not been taught or shown much of anything practical in class. We are sort of making it up as we go. I was really hoping this networking class would offer more practical knowledge about networking, previous courses have just been youtube videos and outdated pdfs.
