### still on binaries, again

covered binaries again. cant find many resources on the way its being taught, mostly how to write a subnetting table like in my earlier blog or how to use a subnetting calculator.

will have a test, mostly on binaries. not really understanding the purpose of this class so far.

a practice test was distributed covering various aspects of subnetting and using top down network design, which is essentially using the application requirements of a user to develop a network starting at the application layer of the OSI model, then progressing down layer by layer.
