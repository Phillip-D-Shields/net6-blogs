### everything, just not connected

Our group has pretty much created all the seperate components required for our assessment, we just dont know how to connect them.

For some reason, the class today recreated our network on physical machines. Again, we struggled with pfsense. The only documentation available for pfsense reads at a professional level, no one in our group can read and understand it. We are also having difficulty googling questions, because we do not know how to word the questions with the proper semantic jargon.  

We don't have a clear path forward. This is frustrating. We have learned almost nothing in this class. Somehow we are meant to create an industry quality network and documentation, which seems like an impossible task because no one in our group has an interest or background in networking. I come to class and try to solve the same problems over and over, the few times I have asked for help from tutors or classmates, no one seems to know what to tell me.
