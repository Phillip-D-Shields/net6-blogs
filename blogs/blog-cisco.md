# Cisco Workshop

Our group, as far as we are aware, were never given any Cisco workshop or tutorial during the semester. There were multiple times when the tutor mentioned that an instructor would come come to class and deliver a Cisco training class that would also give us a basic understanding of Cisco as well as simple certification.

The instructor never came, and just before the semesters end, some classmates passed around links for potential Cisco certifications, but we were never instructed to complete or begin any specific certification.

Upon further inspection of [the Cisco website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications.html), an assortment of training and certification portals exist. If I were to continue on with networking, which I won't, then I would definitely use the link above to upskill and gain some certifications.
