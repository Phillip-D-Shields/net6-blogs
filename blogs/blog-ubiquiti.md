# Ubiquiti Unifi Wi-Fi

Our group had a class session where we were meant to create a physical network and then create an access point for the network using a Ubiquiti Unifi Wi-Fi physical device.

We lacked proper instructions and spent most of our time troubleshooting our network connections between the PF Sense, server, and client. We did not have enough time time to actually complete the installation, and were not able to have a go at the wi-fi device.

After looking at [Ubiquiti website](https://www.ui.com/wi-fi/), it seems like the actual connection and physical device setup are pretty straightforward. If we had more time, I would have liked to finish the setup.
