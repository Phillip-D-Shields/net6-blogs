# Blog - 08

### same

We tried and failed to connect things. Nothing has improved. The group has fallen apart.

These blogs are meant to record our learning process, but we haven't learned anything beyond binary conversions for subnets and top down network design. 

We spent weeks trying to get our two pfsense VM's to communicate only to be told today that they can't actually communicate because of the way Talos is configured. This class has been terrible.
