### Introduce myself

My previous experience with infrastructure and networking is limited to prior NMIT classes. I do not have a strong interest in the subject, but respect its importance and would like a better understanding.

Recently I have become very interested in blockchain technology and would like to pursue that interest further. Networking and infrastructure are crucial to decentralised networks, so a better understanding is needed to be able to properly develop smart contracts and other critical parts of a blockchain network.
