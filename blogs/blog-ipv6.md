A major feature of IPv6 is the way that it simplifies the address configuration. This also simplifies the process through which packets are transmitted.

The main reason for the development of IPv6 is that the remaining number of available IPv4 address have already been alotted. The amount of available IPv6 addresses is extremely larger, but this is not the main intent of IPv6's creation. The main advantage of the longer IPv6 address is that it simplifies allocation of addresses, allows special addressing features, and creates a more effecient route aggregation.
